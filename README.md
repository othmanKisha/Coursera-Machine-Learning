# Assignments of Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng on Coursera
The course consists of 8 assignments about implementing various machine learning algorithms using jupyter notebooks (Officially should be using octave but converted to python using this repo: https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments).
