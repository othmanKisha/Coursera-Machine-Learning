    "In this exercise, you will implement linear regression and get to see it work on data. Before starting on this programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the information you need for solving this assignment is in this notebook, and all the code you will be implementing will take place within this notebook. The assignment can be promptly submitted to the coursera grader directly from this notebook (code and instructions are included below).\n",

    "Before we begin with the exercises, we need to import all libraries required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will be using [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) for all arrays and matrix operations, and [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting.\n",

    "You can find instructions on how to install required libraries in the README file in the [github repository](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments)."

    "- Python array indices start from zero, not one (contrary to OCTAVE/MATLAB). \n",
    "\n",
    "- There is an important distinction between python arrays (called `list` or `tuple`) and `numpy` arrays. You should use `numpy` arrays in all your computations. Vector/matrix operations work only with `numpy` arrays. Python lists do not support vector operations (you need to use for loops).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are seeing many errors at runtime, inspect your matrix operations to make sure that you are adding and multiplying matrices of compatible dimensions. Printing the dimensions of `numpy` arrays using the `shape` property will help you debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By default, `numpy` interprets math operators to be element-wise operators. If you want to do matrix multiplication, you need to use the `dot` function in `numpy`. For, example if `A` and `B` are two `numpy` matrices, then the matrix operation AB is `np.dot(A, B)`. Note that for 2-dimensional matrices or vectors (1-dimensional), this is also equivalent to `A@B` (requires python >= 3.5)."

It's a shortcut string\nnotation described in the *Notes* section below.\n\n>>> plot(x, y)        # plot x and y using default line style and color\n>>> plot(x, y, 'bo')  # plot x and y using blue circle markers\n>>> plot(y)           # plot y using x as index array 0..N-1\n>>> plot(y, 'r+')     # ditto, but with red plusses\n\nYou can use `.Line2D` properties as keyword arguments for more\ncontrol on the appearance. Line properties and *fmt* can be mixed.\nThe following two calls yield identical results:\n\n>>> plot(x, y, 'go--', linewidth=2, markersize=12)\n>>> plot(x, y, color='green', marker='o', linestyle='dashed',\n...      linewidth=2, markersize=12)\n\nWhen conflicting with *fmt*, keyword arguments take precedence.\n\n\n**Plotting labelled data**\n\nThere's a convenient way for plotting objects with labelled data (i.e.\ndata that can be accessed by index ``obj['y']``). Instead of giving\nthe data in *x* and *y*, you can provide the object in the *data*\nparameter and just give the labels for *x* and *y*::\n\n>>> plot('xlabel', 'ylabel', data=obj)\n\nAll indexable objects are supported. This could e.g. be a `dict`, a\n`pandas.DataFame` or a structured numpy array.\n\n\n**Plotting multiple sets of data**\n\nThere are various ways to plot multiple sets of data.\n\n- The most straight forward way is just to call `plot` multiple times.\n  Example:\n\n  >>> plot(x1, y1, 'bo')\n  >>> plot(x2, y2, 'go')\n\n- Alternatively, if your data is already a 2d array, you can pass it\n  directly to *x*, *y*. A separate data set will be drawn for every\n  column.\n\n  Example: an array ``a`` where the first column represents the *x*\n  values and the other columns are the *y* columns::\n\n  >>> plot(a[0], a[1:])\n\n- The third way is to specify multiple sets of *[x]*, *y*, *[fmt]*\n  groups::\n\n  >>> plot(x1, y1, 'g^', x2, y2, 'g-')\n\n  In this case, any additional keyword argument applies to all\n  datasets. Also this syntax cannot be combined with the *data*\n  parameter.\n\nBy default, each line is assigned a different style specified by a\n'style cycle'. The *fmt* and line property parameters are only\nnecessary if you want explicit deviations from these defaults.\nAlternatively, you can also change the style cycle using\n:rc:`axes.prop_cycle`.\n\n\nParameters\n----------\nx, y : array-like or scalar\n    The horizontal / vertical coordinates of the data points.\n    *x* values are optional and default to `range(len(y))`.\n\n    Commonly, these parameters are 1D arrays.\n\n    They can also be scalars, or two-dimensional (in that case, the\n    columns represent separate data sets).\n\n    These arguments cannot be passed as keywords.\n\nfmt : str, optional\n    A format string, e.g. 'ro' for red circles. See the *Notes*\n    section for a full description of the format strings.\n\n    Format strings are just an abbreviation for quickly setting\n    basic line properties. All of these and more can also be\n    controlled by keyword arguments.\n\n    This argument cannot be passed as keyword.\n\ndata : indexable object, optional\n    An object with labelled data. If given, provide the label names to\n    plot in *x* and *y*.\n\n    .. note::\n        Technically there's a slight ambiguity in calls where the\n        second label is a valid *fmt*. `plot('n', 'o', data=obj)`\n        could be `plt(x, y)` or `plt(y, fmt)`. In such cases,\n        the former interpretation is chosen, but a warning is issued.\n        You may suppress the warning by adding an empty format string\n        `plot('n', 'o', '', data=obj)`.\n\nOther Parameters\n----------------\nscalex, scaley : bool, optional, default: True\n    These parameters determined if the view limits are adapted to\n    the data limits. The values are passed on to `autoscale_view`.\n\n**kwargs : `.Line2D` properties, optional\n    *kwargs* are used to specify properties like a line label (for\n    auto legends), linewidth, antialiasing, marker face color.\n    Example::\n\n    >>> plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], 'go-', label='line 1', linewidth=2)\n    >>> plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 4, 9], 'rs', label='line 2')\n\n    If you make multiple lines with one plot command, the kwargs\n    apply to all those lines.\n\n    Here is a list of available `.Line2D` properties:\n\n    Properties:\n    agg_filter: a filter function, which takes a (m, n, 3) float array and a dpi value, and returns a (m, n, 3) array\n    alpha: float or None\n    animated: bool\n    antialiased or aa: bool\n    clip_box: `.Bbox`\n    clip_on: bool\n    clip_path: Patch or (Path, Transform) or None\n    color or c: color\n    contains: callable\n    dash_capstyle: {'butt', 'round', 'projecting'}\n    dash_joinstyle: {'miter', 'round', 'bevel'}\n    dashes: sequence of floats (on/off ink in points) or (None, None)\n    data: (2, N) array or two 1D arrays\n    drawstyle or ds: {'default', 'steps', 'steps-pre', 'steps-mid', 'steps-post'}, default: 'default'\n    figure: `.Figure`\n    fillstyle: {'full', 'left', 'right', 'bottom', 'top', 'none'}\n    gid: str\n    in_layout: bool\n    label: object\n    linestyle or ls: {'-', '--', '-.', ':', '', (offset, on-off-seq), ...}\n    linewidth or lw: float\n    marker: marker style\n    markeredgecolor or mec: color\n    markeredgewidth or mew: float\n    markerfacecolor or mfc: color\n    markerfacecoloralt or mfcalt: color\n    markersize or ms: float\n    markevery: None or int or (int, int) or slice or List[int] or float or (float, float)\n    path_effects: `.AbstractPathEffect`\n    picker: float or callable[[Artist, Event], Tuple[bool, dict]]\n    pickradius: float\n    rasterized: bool or None\n    sketch_params: (scale: float, length: float, randomness: float)\n    snap: bool or None\n    solid_capstyle: {'butt', 'round', 'projecting'}\n    solid_joinstyle: {'miter', 'round', 'bevel'}\n    transform: `matplotlib.transforms.Transform`\n    url: str\n    visible: bool\n    xdata: 1D array\n    ydata: 1D array\n    zorder: float\n\nReturns\n-------\nlines\n    A list of `.Line2D` objects representing the plotted data.\n\nSee Also\n--------\nscatter : XY scatter plot with markers of varying size and/or color (\n    sometimes also called bubble chart).\n\nNotes\n-----\n**Format Strings**\n\nA format string consists of a part for color, marker and line::\n\n    fmt = '[marker][line][color]'\n\nEach of them is optional.

It is also useful to have a legend to distinguish the different lines within the plot. Search online for `pyplot.legend` for help on showing legends in `matplotlib`.\n",
